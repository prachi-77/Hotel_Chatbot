# Hotel Booking Chatbot
This project presents the development and implementation of a hotel booking chatbot leveraging the open-source framework Rasa NLU https://learning.rasa.com/conversational-ai-with-rasa/introduction-to-rasa/. The chatbot is directed towards users who are seeking assistance and information related to hotel bookings. This includes individuals looking to book hotel stays, inquire about existing reservations, or gather 
general information about the hotel's services and facilities. 

**Scope of Chatbot**

We are going to build a chatbot named GrandGuideBot for booking hotel stays. This bot will assist users in booking, cancelling reservations, and providing basic information about our hotel. Let's outline what our chatbot will do:
1. The GrandGuideBot should be able to understand greetings and reply with a greeting.
2. The bot should be able to understand if the user is asking about booking a room, requesting cancellation or seeking general hotel information like location, check-in and check-out times, restaurant hours, nearby tourist spots, and available facilities.
3. The bot should be able to prompt users for details such as their name, contact number for authorization, the number of guests, check-in/check-out dates, and the preferred payment method.
4. After obtaining user details, the bot must offer choices for room typesâ€”single, deluxe, or suite. Additionally, it should allow users to decide if they want to include breakfast in their package.
5. The bot should let users cancel their bookings by asking for their name and booking ID.
6. It should also furnish users with general information about the hotel, such as the availability of various cuisine restaurants, spas, swimming pools, gaming zones, and their operating hours, upon user inquiry.
7. Upon successful booking or cancellation, it should prompt user by asking if there is anything else it can help with.
